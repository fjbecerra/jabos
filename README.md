# jabos

**Just Another Boring Ops System**
Jabos attempts to be a fully automated K8s GitOps framework.

## Goals

- Automate all steps to deploy from Git repositories into a K8s cluster
- No GUI requiring manual human intervention
- Git as a single source of truth
- Pull only model from within runtime environments.
- Isolation of build environment from runtime environment
- Idempotent builds
- Preview environment + Pre-deploy integration testing

## Guidelines

- Minimal set of tools/technologies as pre-requisites/installs
- Stay as tech-stack agnostic as possible
- Minimal steps to install or setup development environment. Automated as possible.

## Installation
